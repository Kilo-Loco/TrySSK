# Offline Search Engine with SimilaritySearchKit

This project leverages the [SimilaritySearchKit](https://github.com/ZachNagengast/similarity-search-kit) to create an efficient and powerful offline search engine. It demonstrates the potential of vector-based similarity search in handling unstructured data, primarily text. Check out the demo video of this project on YouTube:

## Project Status
This project is a one-off demonstration and is currently not being actively developed or maintained. It serves as a proof of concept to showcase the capabilities of the [SimilaritySearchKit](https://github.com/ZachNagengast/similarity-search-kit) in creating an offline search engine. The project is designed to work exclusively on physical devices due to its reliance on `NativeEmbeddings`.
